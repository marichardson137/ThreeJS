# Typeface
Hack like in the movies. It's so easy, you could use your face.

```
$ npm install typeface -g
$ typeface someFilename
```

Now smash your face into the keyboard. Each keypress will write more of the
file to stdout. Hit any number key to type faster, 0 to type normal again.

^w to write (fake)
^c to exit
